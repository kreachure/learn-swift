This repository is an outline and a cheatsheet for Swift lang.
I've written it while comprehending [100 days of SiwftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

# Swift itself
* [Basics](basics.md): 
  * let, var, 
  * simple (Int, Float, Double, Bool, String) 
  * and compound (arrays, sets, dicts) datatypes, 
  * string interpolation `\()`
  * operators (incl. range and ternary), if & switch, and conditions
  * loops
  * functions (external labels, `throwing`, variadic `Int...`, `inout`)
* [Closures](closures.md)
* [Structs and classes](structs.md)
  * structs and classes
  * protocols
  * extensions
  * and protocol extensions :-)
* [Optionals](optionals.md)
  * Int? try? init?() as?

# SwiftUI
Now getting onto the real deal!
* [Project 1: WeSplit](SwiftUI_project1.md)
